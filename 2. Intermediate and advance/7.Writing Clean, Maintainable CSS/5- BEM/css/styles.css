/* 
  BEM
  Block Element Modifier
  To think of a web page based on blocks/modules/containers,
  These blocks can contain elements and can be modified.

  "--" are used to separate a block from a modifier,
  i-e card card--popular where card is a block and card-popular is modifier.

  "__" are used to separate a block from an element.
  i-e card and card__header where card is a block and card__header is an element inside card block

  btn doesn't have any pre-fix that is bcz it is an independent element/block can stand outside this 
  block on its own.
